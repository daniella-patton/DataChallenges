# Data Challenges

Name: Daniella Patton

As a part of Insight Health Data Science Fellows Program, we were given the opportunity to work on two data challenges. The two Jupyter notebooks presented in this reposotiry are the product of a data challenge where we were asked to spend no more than 4 hours on each chalenge. A brief summary of the data challenges are described bellow. Associated csv file are included, when appropriate. 

## Data Challenge 1: 

The goal of this challenge is to forecast core construction material costs.
Data: Pricing information (per unit, in dollars) for the companyâ€™s past purchases over the past ten
years in CSV.
Outcome: Forecast the price of each commodity up to six months into the future. Our manager
wants to understand when a commodity price is about to increase temporarily, to either buy the
commodity early or wait until after the temporary increase.

## Getting Started

All analysis was completed in a jupyter notbeook. All you should need to do is download the notbook and the associated csv file, change your working directory, and run the code.

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
